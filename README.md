<h1> ALGORITHMS USED </h1>
POPULARITY BASED : As the name suggests Popularity based recommendation system works with the trend. It basically uses the items which are in trend right now. For example, if any product which is usually bought by every new user then there are chances that it may suggest that item to the user who just signed up.

CONTENT BASED FILTERING: Content based recommender systems take into account the data provided by the user both directly or indirectly. For example, age can be used to determine classes of products or items reviewed or bought by the user. This type of recommender system relies on characteristics of object. New content can be quickly recommended to the user. These type of systems does not take into account behavior/ data about other users in the systems but here things are little changed.

COSINE SIMILARITY: Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
